🍳 Recipe Agent – IBM watsonx.ai

📖 Overview
The Recipe Agent is an AI-powered assistant built using IBM watsonx.ai’s Agent Lab and Python API.
It demonstrates how to configure, authenticate, and interact with a LangGraph agent to answer recipe-related queries based on available ingredients.

This project combines IBM Cloud Watson Machine Learning, LangGraph, and custom tool functions to create a conversational agent that can:

Search and recommend recipes.

Suggest substitutions for missing ingredients.

Provide step-by-step cooking instructions.

⚠️ This project was developed and executed in the IBM watsonx.ai Agent Lab environment.
Modifying the generated code may affect its ability to run successfully.

🎯 Features
Ingredient-based Recipe Search – Ask the agent what you can cook with what you have.

Cooking Instructions – Get easy-to-follow steps for your chosen recipe.

Substitution Suggestions – Learn how to replace unavailable ingredients.

Cloud-Ready – Built with IBM watsonx.ai, deployable on IBM Cloud.
